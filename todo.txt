List of suggestions
•	Private/public games. Adding passwords
•	Displaying name/number of room in this room
•	Changing properties of game in room such as ranked/unranked or Avalon/resistance
•	Res-only chat
•	Option to remake game, without creating new
•	Custom name rooms
•	/Buzzall option (something like this is good, but private players prolly don’t want be buzzed)
•	Coloring chat (choosing own color or for others)
•	Showing host/all players in room
•	Option to alone upload avatars and rating them, so image may be banned (I don’t like it)
•	Match history

•	Seperating different players chat
•	Readjusting approve/reject button (they aren’t so close and are always at same place)
•	Mvp voting after game (I don’t like it)
•	Levels
•	Assassination clock and picking/voting clock (I like having infinity time for everything, but maybe its good to have some clock)
•	Button to res/spy another player
•	Vote history always visible

•	Better SEO(in progress, Tony wrote it so maybe he knows something about it)
•	Sorting posts on forum
•	Mark as read in forum
•	Display fail/success in vote history

also from old suggestion:anonymous mode

Hak:
•	Disable copying certain texts (maybe useful link http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8957443/prevent-copying-text-in-web-page/12021733#12021733)
•	Fitting game room better in browser (done) 
•	Logout button (done)



Ref:
+margins for text box (first letter touching side)
+smooth borders for text box?
+a less harsh red for rejects and fails
+reject/approve borders doesnt touch head of avatar
+"1 fails"
+remove "disabled" in buttons
+capitalise lady of the lake
+add spaces to the gameplay text
+numbers centered in boxes on mission size
+When pressing start, you should add "requires 5 players to start" message: I think it would feel more responsive instead of simply doing nothing when you press it
